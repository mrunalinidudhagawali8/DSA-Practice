/**
 * Q1 : Can Place Flowers
 *
 * You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.
 *
 * Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
 * Output: false
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
 * flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
 * There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
 * 0 <= n <= flowerbed.length

/**
 * Q2 : 13-04-2025
 * TwoSum : Blind#1
 * Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
 *
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 *
 * You can return the answer in any order.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
 * Output: [0,1]
 * Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
 * Output: [1,2]
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
 * Output: [0,1]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 2 <= nums.length <= 104
 * -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
 * -109 <= target <= 109
 * Only one valid answer exists.

/**
 * Q3 : 13-04-2025
 * 560. Subarray Sym Equals K
 *
 * Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.
 *
 * A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
 * -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
 * -107 <= k <= 107

/**
 * LeetCode121 :
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
 *
 * You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
 *
 * Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
 * Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= prices.length <= 105
 * 0 <= prices[i] <= 104
